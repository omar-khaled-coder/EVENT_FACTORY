<p><strong>2. Customer Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<p>Customers are responsible for canceling their bookings through the platform's interface. Refund eligibility will be determined based on the time of cancellation in accordance with the policy above.</p>

<p><strong>3. Owner Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<p>Owners are expected to prepare and make their space available as per the booking details unless an emergency arises (see below for emergency policies).</p>

<h2>Payment Release Policy (Post-Event)</h2>
<p><strong>1. Standard Payment Release:</strong></p>
<p>Payment will be released to the owner <strong>within 24-48 hours after the event</strong> has successfully taken place. This ensures that the customer is satisfied with the service before the owner receives payment.</p>

<p><strong>2. Special Cases for Last-Minute Bookings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Same-Day Bookings:</strong> Payment will be released to the owner <strong>1 hour before</strong> the event starts.</li>
  <li><strong>Next-Day Bookings:</strong> Payment will be released to the owner <strong>within 12-24 hours after the event</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Dispute Handling:</strong></p>
<p>In case of disputes, a small percentage of the payment (e.g., 10%) may be held back for a short period until the issue is resolved. This is to ensure both parties are treated fairly.</p>

<h2>Owner-Initiated Cancellations Due to Emergencies</h2>
<p><strong>1. Valid Reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sudden Illness or Death (owner or immediate family).</li>
  <li>Natural Disasters that prevent the space from being used.</li>
  <li>Legal or Regulatory Issues that arise unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Proof Requirement:</strong></p>
<p>Owners must provide valid proof (e.g., doctor's note, legal documents) to avoid penalties.</p>

<p><strong>3. Customer Compensation:</strong></p>
<p>Full refund if the owner cancels due to an emergency, and assistance in finding a replacement space if possible.</p>

<p><strong>4. Impact on Owner:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No Penalty if valid proof is provided.</li>
  <li>Penalties apply if proof is not provided, including cancellation fees and negative impact on listing visibility.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Platform's Role:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Mediation between the owner and customer in case of disputes.</li>
  <li>Temporary suspension of the listing if the owner is dealing with a prolonged issue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Communication and Transparency:</strong></p>
<p>All policies must be clearly communicated to both customers and owners, ensuring transparency and understanding.</p>
<p>Ensure that your customer service team is well-trained to handle these situations efficiently and fairly.</p>
